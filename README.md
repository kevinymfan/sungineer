# Premise
You are an engineer that maintains the S.U.N., a floating mechanical light source that provides energy to your tower world.
As you're doing routine maintenance/showing the intern how the thing works, the sun's propulsion system turns off and the sun falls out of the sky! It plummets taking you with it, getting damaged and losing parts on the way down, plunging your tower into darkness.
To fix the sun and put it back where it belongs, you must go floor by floor retrieving the parts and patching up the machinery. You'll encounter puzzles, fight enemies, and get some help from friends to accomplish this goal.

2D platformer with NPC interaction, puzzle solving, and rudimentary combat.
